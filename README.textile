h1. Bees with Machine Guns!

A utility for arming (creating) many bees (micro EC2 instances) to attack (load test) targets (web applications).

Also, retribution for "this shameful act":http://kottke.org/10/10/tiny-catapult-for-throwing-pies-at-bees against a proud hive.

h2. Dependencies

* Python 2.6
* boto
* paramiko

h2. Installation for users

Preferred:

<pre>
pip install beeswithmachineguns
</pre>

or, if you must:

<pre>
easy_install beeswithmachineguns
</pre>

h2. Installation for developers (w/ virtualenv + virtualenvwrapper)

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/newsapps/beeswithmachineguns.git
cd beeswithmachineguns
mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages bees
easy_install pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>

h2. Configuring EC2 credentials

Bees uses boto to communicate with EC2 and thus supports all the same methods of storing credentials that it does.  These include declaring environment variables, machine-global configuration files, and per-user configuration files. You can read more about these options on "boto's configuration page":http://code.google.com/p/boto/wiki/BotoConfig

h2. Usage

A typical bees session looks something like this:

<pre>
bees up -s 4 -g public -k frakkingtoasters
bees attack -n 10000 -c 250 -u http://www.ournewwebbyhotness.com/
bees down
</pre>

This spins up 4 servers in security group 'public' using the EC2 keypair 'frakkingtoasters', whose private key is expected to reside at ~/.ssh/frakkingtoasters.pem.

It then uses those 4 servers to send 10,000 requests, 250 at a time, to attack OurNewWebbyHotness.com.

Lastly, it spins down the 4 servers.  *Please remember to do this*--we aren't responsible for your EC2 bills.

If you wanted 3 agents requesting url A and one requesting url B, your attack would look as follows (empty url -> use previous):

<pre>
bees attack -n 10000 -c 250 -u 'http://url.a,,,http://url.b'
</pre>

For complete options type:

<pre>
bees -h
</pre>

h2. The caveat! (PLEASE READ)

(The following was cribbed from our "original blog post about the bees":http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2010/07/08/bees-with-machine-guns/)

If you decide to use the Bees, please keep in mind the following important caveat: they are, more-or-less a distributed denial-of-service attack in a fancy package and, therefore, if you point them at any server you donâ€™t own you will behaving *unethically*, have your Amazon Web Services account *locked-out*, and be *liable* in a court of law for any downtime you cause.

You have been warned.
